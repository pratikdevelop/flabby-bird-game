# Flappy Bird Game

![Flappy Bird](flappy_bird_screenshot.png)

## Introduction
This project is a simple clone of the popular Flappy Bird game, developed using Unity. It aims to recreate the gameplay mechanics and visual style of the original game.

## Gameplay
In Flappy Bird, the player controls a bird that must navigate through a series of pipes without colliding with them. The bird automatically moves forward, and the player can make it flap its wings to ascend briefly. The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.

## Features
- Simple one-touch controls for easy gameplay.
- Randomly generated pipe layouts to provide endless replayability.
- Score tracking to keep track of the player's progress.
- Sound effects and music to enhance the gaming experience.
